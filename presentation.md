# Microservices Architectures

* Independently developed, deployed, and managed
* Easy to maintain and evolve
* Scalable and reliable
* Containerization makes them agnostic to the infrastructure
* Easy to deploy in the cloud
* Flexible and agile

---
 # A simple example - GPS Replay

* A simulator reads vehicle data (e.g. GPS location) from a csv file and replays it
* The current location of the vehicle needs to be served to a variety of other applications, e.g.:
  * a web app for visualization
  * an app that monitors and computes metrics

---

# What you need to run GPS Replay

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- A command line interface (e.g. bash, terminal)
