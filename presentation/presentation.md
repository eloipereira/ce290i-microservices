# Data-intensive applications

* Applications that process large volumes of data, typically in real time or near-real time
* Examples: recommendation engines, fraud detection, real-time analytics, and scientific research.
* Large heterogeneous stacks, comprised by different services developed by different teams, SW Eng, DE, DS, ML, etc.
* Must meet hard requirements on scale, performance, and security
* Microservices architectures have been widely adopted for data-intensive applications

# Monolithic Architectures: the good

* Traditional software architecture
* All the components are tightly integrated and packaged together
* Application is built, deployed, and scaled as a single unit
* Single codebase
* Small dev footprint: programming languages, tools, and platforms
* Easy to deploy
* Easy to document
* Easy to understand

---
# Monolithic Architectures: the bad

* Difficult to maintain as the application grows in size and functionality
* Difficult to handle legacy code
* Difficult to introduce new features
* Developers need to understand in depth the overall application
* The entire application needs to be scaled together
* Any changes or updates require redeploying the entire application

# Microservices Architectures

* Independently developed, deployed, and managed
* Easy to maintain and evolve
* Scalable and reliable
* Containerization makes them agnostic to the infrastructure
* Easy to deploy in the cloud
* Flexible and agile

---
 # A simple example - GPS Replay

* Read a GPS sensor data from a csv file and replay it in real-time
* Serve the current state to downstream applications, e.g.:
  * A web app dashboard
  * A monitoring tool
  * etc.

# Docker
* Platform for building, shipping, and running applications.
* It uses lightweight containers that are portable and isolated, making them easy to deploy and scale.
* Docker containers share the operating system kernel, but run as isolated processes, which makes them efficient and secure
* Docker is a popular choice for running applications in production
* Docker can be used to run a wide variety of applications, including web applications, databases, and microservices.

---
# Docker - example
* Create a function named `replay_gps_from_csv` that reads `dataset_gps.csv` and replays the GPS data in real-time, printing the result in the command line
* Create a script named `replay_and_print.py`
* Create a dockerfile named `dockerfile.replayer_print` that runs `replay_and_print.py`
* Build and run your container using `docker build` and `docker run`
* Inspect your container using `docker exec`

---
# Docker compose

* Command-line tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications
* Takes a YAML file defining and configuring the services of your application, builds and runs all the services
* Docker Compose makes it easy to define and manage complex multi-container applications
* It also makes it easy to share your applications with other developers or deploy them to production

---
# Docker compose - example
* Create a YAML file named `docker-compose-multi-replayer.yml` with three services, each one being an instance of `dockerfile.replayer_print`
* Build and run your multi-container application using `docker compose build` and `docker compose up`

---
# Client-service REST Microservices
- REST (Representational State Transfer) is a set of architectural principles for designing networked applications based on HTTP
- REST Microservices communicate with each other over HTTP, using HTTP methods (i.e., GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE)
- They exchange data in a lightweight format such as JSON or XML
---
# REST-based GPS Replayer
* Backend microservice
  * Real-time replayer
  * Cache to share state
  * REST API for serving current values
* Frontend microservice
  * Web app requests current values and displays them

# Building and running

- Clone the git repo
  - [https://github.com/eloipereira/ce290i-microservices](https://github.com/eloipereira/ce290i-microservices)
- From your favorite CLI:
  - Build: `docker compose -f docker-compose-rest.yml build`
  - Run: `docker compose -f docker-compose-rest.yml up`
  - Stop: `docker compose -f docker-compose-rest.yml down`
- Open streamlit app: [http://localhost:8501/](http://localhost:8501/)

---
# REST API

- REST API documentation at [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)
- GET /gps_state
  `curl http://localhost:8000/gps_state`
- GET /compute_avg_speed
  `http://localhost:8000/compute_avg_speed?time_window_seconds=10`

---
# REST API: non-blocking

- POST /request_to_compute_avg_speed
`
curl -X 'POST' http://localhost:8000/request_to_compute_avg_speed?time_window_seconds=10
`
- GET /get_avg_speed_task_status
`http://localhost:8000/get_avg_speed_task_status?task_id=<uuid>`

---
# Event-driven microservices
- In event-driven microservices, services communicate and interact with each other by sending messages or reacting upon messages being received
- This architecture allows for asynchronous communication between services, where services can react to events in real-time
- It also enables scalability and fault tolerance, as services can be added or removed without impacting the overall system

---
#  Publish-subscribe (pub-sub)

* Asynchronous communication pattern where senders, known as **publishers**, send messages to a message broker.
* The broker then distributes or broadcasts these messages to multiple receivers, known as **subscribers**
* Publishers do not need to have knowledge of the subscribers
* Publishers and subscribers communicate through topics or channels


---
# Event-driven GPS Replayer
* Redis as pub-sub broker
* GPS replayer service publishes to the redis broker on a topic named `gps_state`
* Streamlit web app subscribes to the `gps_state` topic and reacts upon any message received
![](pubsub.png)

---
# Building and running
- From your favorite CLI:
  - Build: `docker compose -f docker-compose-pubsub.yml build`
  - Run: `docker compose -f docker-compose-pubsub.yml up`
  - Stop: `docker compose -f docker-compose-pubsub.yml down`
- Open streamlit app: [http://localhost:8502/](http://localhost:8502/)

# Conclusion
* Data-intensive applications process large volumes of data and have hard requirements on scale, performance, and security
* They have often large heterogeneous stacks, developed by different teams, such as SW eng, DE, DS, ML, etc
* Microservices architectures have been widely adopted for data-intensive applications
* REST APIs are used whenever the client needs data per request
* Event-driven applications are used whenever the client must react to events in real-time
